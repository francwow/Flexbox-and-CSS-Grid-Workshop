# What is Flexbox?

> "Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns.
> Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces."

## Container and Items

<p> There are different properties for the container and the items within the container. 
We can also refer to them as parent and children elements. </p>

<p> As a general rule, children elements will not exceed their parents width or height 
(even if we set their values to be higher). </p>

### Container Properties

- display: flex;
- flex-direction: row;  // _this property can also be set to other values_
- justify-content: center;  // _this property can also be set to other values_
- align-items: stretch;  // _this property can also be set to other values_

<p> When the display property of the parent container is set to flex, we can move and organize items 
along the x or y axis depending on the value set for the flex-direction property. 
When flex-direction is set to row, items will move along the x-axis with the property justify-content and
they will move along the y-axis with the property align-items. When flex-direction is set to column, 
the logical arrangament of items is iverted, justify content manages the y-axis while align-items
manages the x-axis. </p>
